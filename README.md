# Event RSVP Predictor

Predicting yes-RSVP counts for NYC-based events using data sourced from meetup's API and conducting a member segmentation to find groups of similar members in NYC.

## Motivation
One of the biggest logistical challenges of event planning is in getting a realistic headcount estimation. Much of event planning is contingent on how many attendees are expected, most importantly deciding on an appropriately-sized venue space.  With the trove of past meetup event data, I thought that there might be a way to predict headcount for an event based on features of the event and the group hosting the event.

I started off with some regression models and also worked with classification models by creating headcount bins. Because there was a lot of rich information in the event descriptions, I conducted NLP analysis via topic modeling to find latent topics within the events themselves, across all categories. I used those topics as features in the model.

Lastly, I looked at the NYC-based members and conducted a segmentation to get a sense of natural 'groups' among members themselves.
