No experience is necessary and it is a lot of fun! Our Murder Mystery Parties have become an awesome alternative to the usual bar scene. It is a great way to go out on your own with friends or on your own and meet other fun people in a super organized and different way! What to expect? * Drink Specials until 9pm* Complimentary Appetizers until 8pm* Upon arrival you will be assigned a character and given instructions How does it work? When you arrive our staff will explain the rules to you. You will be given a character that may be the person who everyone is looking for or you may be the person who solves the mystery. (You will not know right away). Our hosts will set the mood and explain what you need to do which is pretty much relax and enjoy the party with all of the other guests who are playing characters too! What's the theme? You will be at the annual Skull Manor Halloween Party. Skull Manor is an old estate in the heart of Spider City known for its captivating architecture, mysterious ambiance and unspeakable history. The townspeople have been scurrying about the streets to get ready for the big night of cocktails, inspiring conversations and, of course, outrageous gossip. This has been a daunting year of dissension and discord among many of the residents of Spider City. Rumors of blackmail, thievery, and scandalous controversies have been circulating throughout the town’s grapevines. We all hope everybody can put aside their differences for a night of fun. If not, there may be misfortune on the horizon. This is where your story begins. FAQs:Can I come alone? Yes 90% of those attending will likely register on their own but you are invited to bring as many guests as you would like just register for that amount. Dress Code? Feel free to wear a costume but it's not required! We will have a best costumes contest following the murder mystery. Age-specific? All are welcome 21 and over. *PURCHASE TICKET AT -  *$20-$30 depending upon how early you purchase. NOT sold at door. Game limited to 40 people and this sells out quickly!</td>\n",

       "0   Full Moon Meditation There will be a full moon meditation October 24th 8pm The Full moon and new moon are thought to have an effect on the body and mind.

       "4   *PURCHASE TICKET AT -  *PREPAY ONLY EVENT. Celebrate Halloween with a twist this year! We have a special Halloween Murder Mystery planned for you on this night. No experience is necessary and it is a lot of fun! Our Murder Mystery Parties have become an awesome alternative to the usual bar scene. It is a great way to go out on your own with friends or on your own and meet other fun people in a super organized and different way! What to expect? * Drink Specials until 9pm* Complimentary Appetizers until 8pm* Upon arrival you will be assigned a character and given instructions How does it work? When you arrive our staff will explain the rules to you. You will be given a character that may be the person who everyone is looking for or you may be the person who solves the mystery. (You will not know right away). Our hosts will set the mood and explain what you need to do which is pretty much relax and enjoy the party with all of the other guests who are playing characters too! What's the theme? You will be at the annual Skull Manor Halloween Party. Skull Manor is an old estate in the heart of Spider City known for its captivating architecture, mysterious ambiance and unspeakable history. The townspeople have been scurrying about the streets to get ready for the big night of cocktails, inspiring conversations and, of course, outrageous gossip. This has been a daunting year of dissension and discord among many of the residents of Spider City. Rumors of blackmail, thievery, and scandalous controversies have been circulating throughout the town’s grapevines. We all hope everybody can put aside their differences for a night of fun. If not, there may be misfortune on the horizon. This is where your story begins. FAQs:Can I come alone? Yes 90% of those attending will likely register on their own but you are invited to bring as many guests as you would like just register for that amount. Dress Code? Feel free to wear a costume but it's not required! We will have a best costumes contest following the murder mystery. Age-specific? All are welcome 21 and over. *PURCHASE TICKET AT -  *$20-$30 depending upon how early you purchase. NOT sold at door. Game limited to 40 people and this sells out quickly!  \n",

Come and let's brainstorm how to fix the healthcare industry! Look forward to an exciting discussion!

Built on the site of the former Domino Sugar Refinery, the park is a tribute to the diversity and resiliency of generations of Domino workers, their families and their neighborhood. Domino Park is proud to welcome the community to this historic site and open this stretch of waterfront to the public for the first time in more than 160 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Rush tickets now available 30 minutes prior to show time up until show time at The Acorn Theatre at Theatre Row Studios! These are subject for availability! A Letter To Harvey Milk tells the story of Harry, an amiable but lonely retired kosher butcher, and Barbara, his young lesbian writing teacher. When Harry fulfills a writing assignment to compose a letter to someone from his past who’s dead, he writes not to his late wife Frannie, but to Harvey Milk, the first openly gay political leader in California. This musical — with its soaring score and deeply-felt, surprisingly funny lyrics — deals with issues of friendship and loss, the grip of the past, and the hard-won acceptance set in motion by the most unexpected people. Group rates are also available in advance for $35 a person for groups of 12 or more! If you can get a group together, we would need for ONE person to agree to pay with a credit card in order to get the group rate!

Here is a simple way to experience the HU.  First, close your eyes and look gently to a point between your eyebrows.  Then, softly sing HU (pronounced like the word \"hue\").  Now sit quietly for a few minutes.  Watch and listen for the presence of God.  It may come as a light or a sound or in some other way.</td>\n",

The Bull Moose Dog Run: For the benefit of our new Members... and any Member who has never been to this venue before, here's a brief overview: German-American architect, Mies van der Rohe once said: \"Less is more!\" Well, that famous quote totally embodies the Bull Moose Dog Run, located on the grounds of The Museum of Natural History! This is, by all definition, your basic no-frills dog run, with just the right ingredients in just the right amounts to satisfy your Beagle's need to socialize, run, howl and play with his/her canine cousins! It is fully fenced, with running water, 2 separate areas and 2 separate entrances, lots of trees for shade, ample seating for us humans... well, what else does one need?! ...a great location? That too!!! The words \"cozy\" and \"intimate\" come to mind when you arrive here, despite the nearby traffic noise and occasional siren! But, despair not... for our Beagle's howls will soon drown out that traffic noise once they get going! The ground surface consists of a mix of fine gravel and dirt, so there is a tendency for canines to kick up some dust as they romp around and frolic, but \"nobody's perfect\" and neither is any dog run I have ever been to! The remedy to this is to simply position yourself correctly to avoid the dust clouds and be ready to give your pooch a hose down when you get home, but the fun our Beagles will have had after this MeetUp concludes will be well worth the clean up operations to follow! Finding parking in this area of Manhattan should definitely be considered for a future Olympic event, for it takes great skill and years of practice to accomplish such a feat (...and a little luck too!). So if you're driving to this venue, be forewarned! The nearby museum will allow you to use their restroom facilities (if you ask the Security Officer very nicely) and can be accessed via the enclosed parking lot entrance adjacent to the dog run.

It's called a \"dog park\" and not a \"dog run\" because the place is HUGE, taking an entire city block. Just click on the Google Map link above and see! It has 4 double gated entrances (2 off of Columbia Heights and 2 off of Vine Street). A separate fenced area is provided for smaller dogs, with its own double gated entrance off of Vine Street. For wheelchair and scooter users, the entrances off of Vine Street are more manageable since they are located on the flatter side of the park. The dog park has natural sloping terrain, with many mature trees and shrubbery. There are ample shaded areas for the Beagle People, lots of hilly areas to give our dogs a more interesting environment to roam and to run in, a real \"wooded area\" with many trees and bushes for our dogs to play hide and seek in, doggie water fountains, a doggie clean up station with a hose and a tub, several circular wooden benches placed around trees and a few picnic tables too. Patrons and volunteers from the neighborhood keep the dog park very clean. Its ground surface is a combination of natural grass areas, mulch and soil. This might be the largest fully fenced dog park in New York City. It is absolutely worth the trip and the hunt for a parking spot if you are driving in! Just allow yourself a little extra time to find street parking. There are no public restrooms available inside the park, however, there are public restrooms at the Brooklyn Bridge Park on Furman Street, just 2 short blocks away.

       "      <td>Welcome to BACK TO BASICS, a new experience in the culinary world.  Come to dine in my \"Casa\" in New York. With \"Back to Basics\" meetups I will introduce you to a new way to learn about Italian food and Italian wine. During my dinners, you will participate in food workshops, where we will be cooking and learning the basics and the history about the great food you are going to eat! During this workshop, we will make an original Italian dish created on 1800, Genova. TROFIE AL PESTO. As a first step, we will be preparing pasta, learning how to make a dough, get familiar with the mixing of water and flour. When the Trofie pasta is ready is the time to make the original Genovese Pesto. Basil, pine nuts, olive oil, Parmigiano cheese, which of course will be mixed by hand as the real pesto is. Back to Basics is also an emotional experience where you will get to cook using an experimental method in a “family-style” environment that will enhance your passions and re-educate your mind and your palate. Acquiring new knowledge, learning to love the value of ingredients and distinctive flavors, are the key elements in creating your dishes and gaining confidence in your kitchen. Family dinners are a Historical Value of the Italian Culture. It is my aspirations to make people understand that by sharing together a lunch or a dinner while sipping good wine, will increase relations and will improve, health and living in harmony. Ready to reserve your dinner? Please contact me before the reservation. The event will have a cost of $55 per person; which will include the workshop, the dinner, and the drinks. Meal: 2 courses dinner Drinks: Wine and Water THIS ARE PRIVATE CLASSES but you can BRING 2 FRIENDS. ** Private dinners at your house are available, ask for pricing.</td>\n",

       "5073   *This Meetup repeats every weekend.* Come experience the Off-Broadway Production, A Letter to Harvey Milk, for only $25 (Tickets are valued at $79). Rush tickets now available 30 minutes prior to show time up until show time at The Acorn Theatre at Theatre Row Studios! These are subject for availability! A Letter To Harvey Milk tells the story of Harry, an amiable but lonely retired kosher butcher, and Barbara, his young lesbian writing teacher. When Harry fulfills a writing assignment to compose a letter to someone from his past who’s dead, he writes not to his late wife Frannie, but to Harvey Milk, the first openly gay political leader in California. This musical — with its soaring score and deeply-felt, surprisingly funny lyrics — deals with issues of friendship and loss, the grip of the past, and the hard-won acceptance set in motion by the most unexpected people. Group rates are also available in advance for $35 a person for groups of 12 or more! If you can get a group together, we would need for ONE person to agree to pay with a credit card in order to get the group rate! We would then discuss a date and time, and move forward with securing these tickets with the box office! Our show times are as follows: Tuesday:  PMWednesday:  PM and  PMThursday:  PMFriday:  PMSaturday:  PM and  PMSunday:  PM For more information, contact me (Natalie Brock) at [masked].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "5648   Please read the rules and regulations of Hudson River Park Tennis Courts: We are going to start when there is an available court at 7pm or later. I am usually at the courts at around 6pm (the wait is typically about an hour). If no other members are present when a court is available, I am going to surrender the court and the start time is likely to get pushed back by 30-40 mins. I will comment in the meetup should this occur. Feel free to bring your friends. I will be present (unless RSVPd otherwise), but do not mind giving up my spot if we end up with too many people. When we do get 4+ attendees, we rotate every 10 minutes, letting everyone hit with everyone else, regardless of the skill level. When rotating, please be courteous to other attendees. Sadly the limit at HR is an hour regardless of the number of players, but if there is nobody else waiting, this should not be an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "6480     Come join us for a 30 minute HU Song with time for fellowship and refreshments afterwards. Even though the introduction will be in French HU is universal and there will be many who speak both French and English to talk with you. The HU is an ancient name for God. Singing it is a love song to God.  It is a wonderful way to open your heart to the Light and Sound of God.  By singing it you can bring peace and calmness into your life, find answers and experience the Divine Love of God. Here is a simple way to experience the HU.  First, close your eyes and look gently to a point between your eyebrows.  Then, softly sing HU (pronounced like the word \"hue\").  Now sit quietly for a few minutes.  Watch and listen for the presence of God.  It may come as a light or a sound or in some other way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

It is freely given - a gift beyond measure. There will be time afterward for fellowship and light refreshments. Here is a simple way to experience the HU. First, close your eyes and look gently to a point between your eyebrows. Then, softly sing HU (pronounced like the word \"hue\"). Now sit quietly for a few minutes. Watch and listen for the presence of God. It may come as a light or a sound or in some other way. Sing it from your heart and there will be infinite ways to benefit from its blessings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Its entrance is double gated and secure. There are no public restrooms available on site.

The Carl Schurz Park Dog Run at Gracie Square: This dog run is one of NYC's best kept secrets, located at Gracie Square, which also houses Gracie Mansion... our Mayor's residence. It is located in an idyllic setting, overlooking the East River. This dog run is circular in shape, with two double entrance gates. It is fully enclosed by a perimeter fence above a continuous concrete wall and has a doggie water station, a hose down station, seating for the Beagle People, shaded areas and even public restroom facilities nearby. The ground surface is primarily composed of fine sand and pebbles. There are actually TWO dog runs at this venue. The \"small dog\" run is reserved for canines under 23 pounds and is provided with a very low perimeter fence which will not hold any Beagle who has visually \"locked on\" to a squirrel 50 yards away!!

       "24543  PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING SO THAT OTHER MEMBERS CAN SEE THE EXPECTED TURNOUT AT EACH VENUE! The Bull Moose Dog Run: For the benefit of our new Members... and any Member who has never been to this venue before, here's a brief overview: German-American architect, Mies van der Rohe once said: \"Less is more!\" Well, that famous quote totally embodies the Bull Moose Dog Run, located on the grounds of The Museum of Natural History! This is, by all definition, your basic no-frills dog run, with just the right ingredients in just the right amounts to satisfy your Beagle's need to socialize, run, howl and play with his/her canine cousins! It is fully fenced, with running water, 2 separate areas and 2 separate entrances, lots of trees for shade, ample seating for us humans... well, what else does one need?! ...a great location? That too!!! The words \"cozy\" and \"intimate\" come to mind when you arrive here, despite the nearby traffic noise and occasional siren! But, despair not... for our Beagle's howls will soon drown out that traffic noise once they get going! The ground surface consists of a mix of fine gravel and dirt, so there is a tendency for canines to kick up some dust as they romp around and frolic, but \"nobody's perfect\" and neither is any dog run I have ever been to! The remedy to this is to simply position yourself correctly to avoid the dust clouds and be ready to give your pooch a hose down when you get home, but the fun our Beagles will have had after this MeetUp concludes will be well worth the clean up operations to follow! Finding parking in this area of Manhattan should definitely be considered for a future Olympic event, for it takes great skill and years of practice to accomplish such a feat (...and a little luck too!). So if you're driving to this venue, be forewarned! The nearby museum will allow you to use their restroom facilities (if you ask the Security Officer very nicely) and can be accessed via the enclosed parking lot entrance adjacent to the dog run.

       "24544  The DiMattina Dog Run: This dog run has an intimate, cozy feeling, not too large, not too small... \"just right\" and with all the bells and whistles to boot! It offers two large fully fenced areas: one for small/medium dogs and one for large dogs, with a double-gated entrance. There are two doggie water fountains, two \"hose down\" stations to clean up your canine kids when they are ready to leave, lots of shade from trees, ample seating areas for the Beagle People and it even has a plastic doggie pool to cool off our pooches during hot weather. The ground surface is composed of fine sand and small pebbles. There are no restroom facilities on premises. However, there are public restrooms just one short block away at a nearby children's playground (visible from the dog run). Street parking is usually available near the park or on the adjacent residential streets just one or two blocks away.

       "24545  PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING THIS MEETUP! The Cunningham Park Dog Run: This is by far one of the best dog runs in Queens! It is clean, well maintained, with doggie water fountains provided and lots of shade from mature trees. Plenty of seating benches/picnic tables are available for the humans and there is ample street parking (but please READ the parking signs for areas in which parking is not permitted!). The ground surface is composed of dirt and wood chips. Two fully fenced areas separate the smaller dogs from the medium/large dogs. The park has restrooms, but sometimes they are not open.

       "24546  PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING! The Hillside Dog Park: Rated the BEST dog park in Brooklyn... and quite possibly in all of New York City! It's called a \"dog park\" and not a \"dog run\" because the place is HUGE, taking an entire city block. Just click on the Google Map link above and see! It has 4 double gated entrances (2 off of Columbia Heights and 2 off of Vine Street). A separate fenced area is provided for smaller dogs, with its own double gated entrance off of Vine Street. For wheelchair and scooter users, the entrances off of Vine Street are more manageable since they are located on the flatter side of the park. The dog park has natural sloping terrain, with many mature trees and shrubbery. There are ample shaded areas for the Beagle People, lots of hilly areas to give our dogs a more interesting environment to roam and to run in, a real \"wooded area\" with many trees and bushes for our dogs to play hide and seek in, doggie water fountains, a doggie clean up station with a hose and a tub, several circular wooden benches placed around trees and a few picnic tables too. Patrons and volunteers from the neighborhood keep the dog park very clean. Its ground surface is a combination of natural grass areas, mulch and soil. This might be the largest fully fenced dog park in New York City. It is absolutely worth the trip and the hunt for a parking spot if you are driving in! Just allow yourself a little extra time to find street parking. There are no public restrooms available inside the park, however, there are public restrooms at the Brooklyn Bridge Park on Furman Street, just 2 short blocks away. For those of you who have never been to this dog park, here's a video preview below. These videos do not show all of the features and areas of the dog park, but they will give you an idea of what to expect when you get there... especially the last one!

       "24767  Welcome to BACK TO BASICS, a new experience in the culinary world.  Come to dine in my \"Casa\" in New York. With \"Back to Basics\" meetups I will introduce you to a new way to learn about Italian food and Italian wine. During my dinners, you will participate in food workshops, where we will be cooking and learning the basics and the history about the great food you are going to eat! During this workshop, we will make an original Italian dish created on 1800, Genova. TROFIE AL PESTO. As a first step, we will be preparing pasta, learning how to make a dough, get familiar with the mixing of water and flour. When the Trofie pasta is ready is the time to make the original Genovese Pesto. Basil, pine nuts, olive oil, Parmigiano cheese, which of course will be mixed by hand as the real pesto is. Back to Basics is also an emotional experience where you will get to cook using an experimental method in a “family-style” environment that will enhance your passions and re-educate your mind and your palate. Acquiring new knowledge, learning to love the value of ingredients and distinctive flavors, are the key elements in creating your dishes and gaining confidence in your kitchen. Family dinners are a Historical Value of the Italian Culture. It is my aspirations to make people understand that by sharing together a lunch or a dinner while sipping good wine, will increase relations and will improve, health and living in harmony. Ready to reserve your dinner? Please contact me before the reservation. The event will have a cost of $55 per person; which will include the workshop, the dinner, and the drinks.

       "4395   Mondays from 7:30 – 9 pm with Yasuko Kasaki  Chris Pelham A Course in Miracles and A Course of Love classes are $20 each Know your life purpose and the meaning of your current situation clearly. Communicate with your Inner Teacher. Heal yourself and others. These ongoing classes focus on mind training designed to help you to experience the lessons and wisdom of ACIM. Each Monday class contains some lecture from the ACIM Textbook and/or Urtext, some discussion and QA, and typically 20 – 30 minutes of meditation, creative visualization and/or spiritual reading practice in order to experience mind change. Our primary goal in these classes is for each student to learn to listen to the guidance of Holy Spirit and live his/her life with certainty and peace. Slowly, you will re-train your eyes to see the world around you without judgment. You will learn to communicate with your holy spirit. You can find the text online here (http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Course_in_Miracles), among other places. Students of all experience levels and backgrounds are welcome! Yasuko Kasaki (http://crsny.org/yasuko/about) has been teaching A Course in Miracles and offering spiritual counseling and healing since 1999. She has approximately 1,000 students and clients. In 2004, she opened CRS, the first and only spiritual center in New York City devoted to the study and practice of ACIM. Ms. Kasaki is the author of 21 books published by major publishers in Japan. You can listen to a sampling of Yasuko's recent guided meditations here:http://crsny.podbean.com Christopher Pelham (http://www.crsny.org/about-christopher-pelham) currently serves as teaching assistant for the Monday class and will sometimes lead the group when Ms. Kasaki is away. He is the Director and a co-founder of CRS (Center for Remembering  Sharing) (http://www.crsny.org/). He balances his time between overseeing the growth and health of the CRS community, producing arts/cultural/educational events at the Center, and working as a CRS Healer and student and teacher of A Course in Miracles (http://www.meetup.com/ACIM-class/). In addition to studying ACIM with Yasuko Kasaki (http://www.crsny.org/instructor/yasuko-kasaki) since 2003, he studied the Spiritual Psychology of Acting (http://spiritualpsychologyofacting.com/) with London-based teacher John Osborne Hughes (http://spiritualpsychologyofacting.com/about-the-teacher/) and Keith Johnstone-based Improvisation with the late Gloria Maddox (http://www.mindspring.com/~cpelham/Gloria.html).

       "5073   *This Meetup repeats every weekend.* Come experience the Off-Broadway Production, A Letter to Harvey Milk, for only $25 (Tickets are valued at $79). Rush tickets now available 30 minutes prior to show time up until show time at The Acorn Theatre at Theatre Row Studios! These are subject for availability! A Letter To Harvey Milk tells the story of Harry, an amiable but lonely retired kosher butcher, and Barbara, his young lesbian writing teacher. When Harry fulfills a writing assignment to compose a letter to someone from his past who’s dead, he writes not to his late wife Frannie, but to Harvey Milk, the first openly gay political leader in California. This musical — with its soaring score and deeply-felt, surprisingly funny lyrics — deals with issues of friendship and loss, the grip of the past, and the hard-won acceptance set in motion by the most unexpected people. Group rates are also available in advance for $35 a person for groups of 12 or more! If you can get a group together, we would need for ONE person to agree to pay with a credit card in order to get the group rate! We would then discuss a date and time, and move forward with securing these tickets with the box office! Our show times are as follows: Tuesday: 7:00 PMWednesday: 2:00 PM and 7:00 PMThursday: 7:00 PMFriday: 8:00 PMSaturday: 2:00 PM and 8:00 PMSunday: 3:00 PM For more information, contact me (Natalie Brock) at [masked].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "5648   Please read the rules and regulations of Hudson River Park Tennis Courts:https://hudsonriverpark.org/explore-the-park/activities/tennis We are going to start when there is an available court at 7pm or later. I am usually at the courts at around 6pm (the wait is typically about an hour). If no other members are present when a court is available, I am going to surrender the court and the start time is likely to get pushed back by 30-40 mins. I will comment in the meetup should this occur. Feel free to bring your friends. I will be present (unless RSVPd otherwise), but do not mind giving up my spot if we end up with too many people. When we do get 4+ attendees, we rotate every 10 minutes, letting everyone hit with everyone else, regardless of the skill level. When rotating, please be courteous to other attendees. Sadly the limit at HR is an hour regardless of the number of players, but if there is nobody else waiting, this should not be an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "6480     Come join us for a 30 minute HU Song with time for fellowship and refreshments afterwards. Even though the introduction will be in French HU is universal and there will be many who speak both French and English to talk with you. The HU is an ancient name for God. Singing it is a love song to God.  It is a wonderful way to open your heart to the Light and Sound of God.  By singing it you can bring peace and calmness into your life, find answers and experience the Divine Love of God. Here is a simple way to experience the HU.  First, close your eyes and look gently to a point between your eyebrows.  Then, softly sing HU (pronounced like the word \"hue\").  Now sit quietly for a few minutes.  Watch and listen for the presence of God.  It may come as a light or a sound or in some other way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "24537  PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING! The Stuyvesant Park Dog Run: This MeetUp will be held at the PERMANENT dog run location (just recently renovated) accessible via the East 15th Street entrance off of 2nd Avenue. Presently there is no separate area for smaller dogs. This dog run has ample perimeter seating benches for humans and lots of mature trees. The pavement consists of a combination of cobblestones and concrete pavers. There is no water available at present, so you will need to bring your own water until all construction work is completed.

       "24538  PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING! The Carl Schurz Park Dog Run at Gracie Square: This dog run is one of NYC's best kept secrets, located at Gracie Square, which also houses Gracie Mansion... our Mayor's residence. It is located in an idyllic setting, overlooking the East River. This dog run is circular in shape, with two double entrance gates. It is fully enclosed by a perimeter fence above a continuous concrete wall and has a doggie water station, a hose down station, seating for the Beagle People, shaded areas and even public restroom facilities nearby. The ground surface is primarily composed of fine sand and pebbles. There are actually TWO dog runs at this venue. The \"small dog\" run is reserved for canines under 23 pounds and is provided with a very low perimeter fence which will not hold any Beagle who has visually \"locked on\" to a squirrel 50 yards away!!

       "24543  PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING SO THAT OTHER MEMBERS CAN SEE THE EXPECTED TURNOUT AT EACH VENUE! The Bull Moose Dog Run: For the benefit of our new Members... and any Member who has never been to this venue before, here's a brief overview: German-American architect, Mies van der Rohe once said: \"Less is more!\" Well, that famous quote totally embodies the Bull Moose Dog Run, located on the grounds of The Museum of Natural History! This is, by all definition, your basic no-frills dog run, with just the right ingredients in just the right amounts to satisfy your Beagle's need to socialize, run, howl and play with his/her canine cousins! It is fully fenced, with running water, 2 separate areas and 2 separate entrances, lots of trees for shade, ample seating for us humans... well, what else does one need?! ...a great location? That too!!! The words \"cozy\" and \"intimate\" come to mind when you arrive here, despite the nearby traffic noise and occasional siren! But, despair not... for our Beagle's howls will soon drown out that traffic noise once they get going! The ground surface consists of a mix of fine gravel and dirt, so there is a tendency for canines to kick up some dust as they romp around and frolic, but \"nobody's perfect\" and neither is any dog run I have ever been to! The remedy to this is to simply position yourself correctly to avoid the dust clouds and be ready to give your pooch a hose down when you get home, but the fun our Beagles will have had after this MeetUp concludes will be well worth the clean up operations to follow! Finding parking in this area of Manhattan should definitely be considered for a future Olympic event, for it takes great skill and years of practice to accomplish such a feat (...and a little luck too!). So if you're driving to this venue, be forewarned! The nearby museum will allow you to use their restroom facilities (if you ask the Security Officer very nicely) and can be accessed via the enclosed parking lot entrance adjacent to the dog run.

       "24544  The DiMattina Dog Run: This dog run has an intimate, cozy feeling, not too large, not too small... \"just right\" and with all the bells and whistles to boot! It offers two large fully fenced areas: one for small/medium dogs and one for large dogs, with a double-gated entrance. There are two doggie water fountains, two \"hose down\" stations to clean up your canine kids when they are ready to leave, lots of shade from trees, ample seating areas for the Beagle People and it even has a plastic doggie pool to cool off our pooches during hot weather. The ground surface is composed of fine sand and small pebbles. There are no restroom facilities on premises. However, there are public restrooms just one short block away at a nearby children's playground (visible from the dog run). Street parking is usually available near the park or on the adjacent residential streets just one or two blocks away.

       "24546  PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING! The Hillside Dog Park: Rated the BEST dog park in Brooklyn... and quite possibly in all of New York City! It's called a \"dog park\" and not a \"dog run\" because the place is HUGE, taking an entire city block. Just click on the Google Map link above and see! It has 4 double gated entrances (2 off of Columbia Heights and 2 off of Vine Street). A separate fenced area is provided for smaller dogs, with its own double gated entrance off of Vine Street. For wheelchair and scooter users, the entrances off of Vine Street are more manageable since they are located on the flatter side of the park. The dog park has natural sloping terrain, with many mature trees and shrubbery. There are ample shaded areas for the Beagle People, lots of hilly areas to give our dogs a more interesting environment to roam and to run in, a real \"wooded area\" with many trees and bushes for our dogs to play hide and seek in, doggie water fountains, a doggie clean up station with a hose and a tub, several circular wooden benches placed around trees and a few picnic tables too. Patrons and volunteers from the neighborhood keep the dog park very clean. Its ground surface is a combination of natural grass areas, mulch and soil. This might be the largest fully fenced dog park in New York City. It is absolutely worth the trip and the hunt for a parking spot if you are driving in! Just allow yourself a little extra time to find street parking. There are no public restrooms available inside the park, however, there are public restrooms at the Brooklyn Bridge Park on Furman Street, just 2 short blocks away. For those of you who have never been to this dog park, here's a video preview below. These videos do not show all of the features and areas of the dog park, but they will give you an idea of what to expect when you get there... especially the last one! https://youtu.be/OdD2Z6Uy2qg https://youtu.be/S-EFU3__8pE https://youtu.be/2XXO4vbY2Ik https://youtu.be/R9IuIGYIcLY IMPORTANT: Attendance at this MeetUp event is purely voluntary and you do so at your own risk.

       "24767  Welcome to BACK TO BASICS, a new experience in the culinary world.  Come to dine in my \"Casa\" in New York. With \"Back to Basics\" meetups I will introduce you to a new way to learn about Italian food and Italian wine. During my dinners, you will participate in food workshops, where we will be cooking and learning the basics and the history about the great food you are going to eat! During this workshop, we will make an original Italian dish created on 1800, Genova. TROFIE AL PESTO. As a first step, we will be preparing pasta, learning how to make a dough, get familiar with the mixing of water and flour. When the Trofie pasta is ready is the time to make the original Genovese Pesto. Basil, pine nuts, olive oil, Parmigiano cheese, which of course will be mixed by hand as the real pesto is. Back to Basics is also an emotional experience where you will get to cook using an experimental method in a “family-style” environment that will enhance your passions and re-educate your mind and your palate. Acquiring new knowledge, learning to love the value of ingredients and distinctive flavors, are the key elements in creating your dishes and gaining confidence in your kitchen. Family dinners are a Historical Value of the Italian Culture. It is my aspirations to make people understand that by sharing together a lunch or a dinner while sipping good wine, will increase relations and will improve, health and living in harmony. Ready to reserve your dinner? Please contact me before the reservation. The event will have a cost of $55 per person; which will include the workshop, the dinner, and the drinks. Meal: 2 courses dinner Drinks: Wine and Water THIS ARE PRIVATE CLASSES but you can BRING 2 FRIENDS. ** Private dinners at your house are available, ask for pricing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
